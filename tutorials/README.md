# Module for event management for js objects

Instances of this class or class extending {@link module:GeneralEventTarget~GeneralEventTarget|GeneralEventTarget}, participate in an event system.
This system enables communication between js instances of different types.

See the [How-To]{@tutorial How-To} for using the module

## Purpose

On the client side in javascript's event system only works on dom element. This event system will is used
for normal javascript objects.

But the main reason is for the creation of this module is having implemented an own event system to get a better understanding for
events in general in programming environment
