# Module for event management for js objects

Instances of this class or class extending {@link module:GeneralEventTarget~GeneralEventTarget|GeneralEventTarget}, participate in an event system.
This system enables communication between js instances of different types.

See the [How-To]{@tutorial How-To} for using the module

## Purpose

On the client side the javascript event system only works on dom elements. This event system is used
for normal javascript objects.

The implementation of this module as an own event system grants better understanding about event system in javascript
